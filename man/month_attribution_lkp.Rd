\title{creates table of weights to apply to dates that represent the end of a week.
These weights correspond tot he proportion of that week's counts that fall
into the month that the "week end date" occurs, and the proportion of the
counts that fall into the previous month}
\usage{
month_attribution_lkp(week_end_dates)
}
\arguments{
\item{week_end_dates}{vector of dates that represent the final date of the
week in consideration (this doesn't have to be a specific day of the week
as the reference point for this purpose is the end of the month which can
fall on any day of the week)}
}
\value{
a tibble of week_end, wait_start_month, month_weight where week_end
  are the dates provided, wait_start_month is the start of the month that the
  waiting period began, and month_weight is a value between 0 and
  1 to apply to the counts within that week
}
\description{
rtt data is published monthly and represents a snapshot of
  counts at the end of the given month. The weekly counts are provided within
  the data. To convert the weekly counts to monthly counts we must sum the
  weekly counts within each month. Some weeks will fall over month ends, so
  this function identifies those, and calculates the number of days those
  weeks fall within each month. These days are then used to calculate a
  weighting, which is the output of the function.
