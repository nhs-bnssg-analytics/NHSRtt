\arguments{
\item{t_1_capacity}{numeric; a single value for the capacity for the first
time period of the projected time period}

\item{referrals_projections}{numeric; a vector for the number of referrals
for each period in the projected time period}

\item{incomplete_pathways}{tibble; two column data frame or tibble, with
fields called months_waited_id (taking values 0 to the maximum months
waited group of interest), and incompletes (the count of the number of
incomplete pathways) representing the count of incomplete pathways at
timestep 0 (to initialise the model with)}

\item{renege_capacity_params}{tibble; three column data frame or tibble, with
fields called months_waited_id (taking values 0 to the maximum months
waited group of interest), and fields called capacity_param and
renege_param, which are outputs from the function
\code{calibrate_capacity_renege_params()}}

\item{target}{string length 1; can be either a percentage point change, eg,
"~-5\%" or a percent value, eg, "5\%". This refers to percentage of
patients on the waiting list in the \code{target_bin} or higher waiting
times. Note, this is the opposite of the NHS RTT targets, which are a
proportion of patients on the waiting list that are below the
\code{target_bin}}

\item{target_bin}{numeric length 1; the bin that the target refers to. It
must be less than or equal to the max_months_waited value}

\item{capacity_profile}{string, one of "linear_change" or "flat"; determines
how the capacity counts vary into the future. Linear change means that the
first point is held stationary at the value of \code{t_1_capacity} and the
end point is varied, with a linear interpolation between the two points.
Flat means that capacity remains constant into the future}

\item{surplus_treatment_redistribution_method}{string; one of "none",
"evenly" or "prioritise_long_waiters"; should cases where the counts of
reneges and treatments exceed the counts of people waiting be
redistributed, and if so, which method should be used}

\item{tolerance}{numeric length 1; the tolerance used to compare the absolute
error with in the max_months_waited bin to determine convergence. The
absolute error is calculated on the proportion in the max_months_waited bin
relative to the total waiting (even if a non-percentage target is used)}

\item{max_iterations}{numeric; the maximum number of iterations to test for
convergence before providing a warning and an invalid number}
}
\value{
A capacity multiplier representing that is applied to the
  \code{t_1_capacity} input to achieve the desired target by the end of the
  projection period. Where the \code{capacity_profile} is 'linear_change',
  this represent a linear growth in capacity from
  \ifelse{html}{\out{t<sub>1</sub>}}{\eqn{t_1}} to
  \ifelse{html}{\out{t<sub>13</sub>}}{\eqn{t_13}}, where
  \ifelse{html}{\out{t<sub>1</sub>}}{\eqn{t_1}} is equal to
  \code{t_1_capacity} and \ifelse{html}{\out{t<sub>13</sub>}}{\eqn{t_13}} is
  \code{t_1_capacity} multiplied by the output of the function.

  If \code{capacity_profile} is 'flat', then the projected capacity is simply
  \code{t_1_capacity} multiplied by the output of the function for the whole
  of the projected period.

  The name of the returned object provides an indication of whether the
  optimiser converged.
