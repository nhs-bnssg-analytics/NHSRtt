\title{Pivot the parameters passed into the function so relationships between the
parameters remain consistent but giving control to providing more or less
focus on extreme bins}
\usage{
apply_parameter_skew(params, skew, skew_method = "rotate", pivot_bin = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{params}{numeric vector of parameters; assumed to be in order of
increasing waiting times (bins)}

\item{skew}{numeric; length 1, a multiplier to be used on the final
parameter. A skew of 1 will keep the params identical to the input params.
Value must be greater than 0}

\item{skew_method}{character; one of "rotate" or "uniform". The "rotate"
method will multiply the highest bin by the skew value, the pivot_bin will
remain the same as its input, and all of the other bins between the pivot
bin and the highest bin will be multiplied by an interpolated value between
1 and the skew value. Bins between the second bin and the pivot bin will be
multiplied by interpolated value between (1 / skew) and 1. If the method is
"uniform", then all of the bins greater than or equal to the pivot bin will
be multiplied by the skew value, and the bins below the pivot bin will be
multiplied by (1 / skew)}

\item{pivot_bin}{numeric; when applying the skew, whichever method, select a
bin to pivot around. If NULL, the mid-bin between the highest available bin
and the second bin will be used. The first item of the parameter inputs is
bin 0, so a pivot_bin of 2, will be the third item}

\value{
a revised numeric vector of parameters

\description{
Pivot the parameters passed into the function so relationships between the
parameters remain consistent but giving control to providing more or less
focus on extreme bins
}
\details{
The skew parameter is applied to the final item of the params
  vector. The inverse of the skew parameter is applied to the second item of
  the params vector. The adjustment made to the items in between item to and
  item n are calculated by a linear extrapolation between the inverse skew
  and the skew. The first item is held constant.

  params = c(0.03, 0.02, 0.02, 0.01, 0.04, 0.05),
